    <p>1. inside a head</p>
    <p>2. inside and above the body closing tag</p>
    <p>3. using asyncronous inside the head</p>
    <p>4. using defer inside head</p>

    <!-- 2. - disadvantage - takes time to load.. first html gets loaded then the firstjs. but thus is also recommended other then 4th one-->
    <!-- The script is placed at the end of the body, ensuring that the HTML content is fully loaded before the JavaScript is executed. -->
