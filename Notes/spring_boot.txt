Spring framework
Spring boot
IOC Container
Dependency Injection


Spring Framework:
=================
* It is java framework  that is used to develop  a web applications, Rest-API, Enterprice level applications.
* MVC - we have to do lot of configurations in spring.

* Spring framework is developed using concept of module.
* Spring is used XML Configuration / annotation(java) configuuration

Generally:
==========
1. security
2. database
3. mvc / mvt

3 problems:
===========
1. we have to do lot of configuartions.
2. we have to deploy the application in tomcat server.
3. to test the application in test module we have to do lot of configuration.

Spring Boot:
============
* It is build on the top of Spring framework, so we can achive RAD(Rapid application developement).

IOC Container:
==============
* in normal java using new keyword we are creating an object.
* handled to sring "Bean".
* Inversion of control -> no need to create an object as programmer the spring we take care creation of obbject.
* we have to give some of the information of the class.
* it will create, configure and manage the spring bean/objects.


Dependency Injection:
=====================
* injecting the one object to another object.
example: has-a relationship
========
class Student{
	private int id;
	private String name;
	privte Address address;
}

class Address{
	private String city;
	private String state;
}

3.ways to achive dependency injection:
======================================
1. constructor injection - best(recomended)
2. setter injection
3. field injection
